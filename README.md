The goal of zstinsight is to …

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist    
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 43  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
